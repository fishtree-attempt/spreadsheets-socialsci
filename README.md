METHODS OF DATA COLLECTION
*******************************************************************************************************

1. Describe the methods for data collection and / or provide links to papers describing data collection methods:
This is survey data relating to households and agriculture in Tanzania and Mozambique. The survey data was collected
through interviews conducted between November 2016 and June 2017. This is a teaching version of the dataset, 
not the full version. 

2. Instrument information:
The survey was split into several sections: 
A - General questions about when and where the survey was conducted;
B - Information about the household and how long they have been living in the area;
C - Details about the accommodation and other buildings on the farm;
D - Details about different plots of land they grow crops on;
E - Details about how they irrigate the land and availability of water;
F - Financial details including assets owned and sources of income;
G - Details of financial hardships;
X - Information collected directly from the smartphone (GPS) or automatically included in the form (InstanceID). 

3. Data procesessing:
The survey data was collected through interviews using forms downloaded to Android Smartphones. The survey forms were
created using the ODK (Open Data Kit) software via an Excel spreadsheet. The collected data were then sent back to the server. 
The server can be used to download the collected data in both JSON and CSV formats. 

4. Analysis methods:
Descriptive and summary statistics were calculated using SPSS.
