## Setup

There is no specific setup requied for this lesson, although it is assumed that Excel will be available. 
Providing Excel files can be opened in some spreadsheet system most of the examples should work. 
Episode 2 makes more exteensive use of Excel formulas, I do not know how well they translate to other systems. But the whole episode is an Instructor led walkthrough.


## The datasets used

All of the datasets used have been placed in the data folder.

They should be downloaded to the local machine before use.

Some knowledge of using Excel formulas might be useful, butthe steps are small and explained. 

[Formatting problems](link)

This episode uses a created spreadsheet loosley based on SAFI data to illustrate a variety of bad practices

It is essentially a single exercise to spot as many as possible and the solution is the explanation of what they are and why you should avoid them.

There is also a discussion of Metadata, what it is and why in general it should be seperate from the actual data. It is illustrated by reference to the SN7577 data dictionary.

Other Spreadsheet programs may have something similar.

The benefits of data validation on input are explained.

[Exporting data](link)

This episode covers the Excel file storage format. And explains how you can dissect it.

It explains the advantage of saving files to csv format and shows how to do it.

It covers some of the things that can go wrong with csv formatted files.

An example of adding the filename of the spreadsheet as part of the data of the spreadsheet is shown.
This requires quite complex manipulation of Excel formulas and use of string functions. You could stop after the '=CELL("filename") step if you wanted.
